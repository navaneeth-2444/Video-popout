# Video-popout
Yeah so one day I was using Brave and it's got this really good youtube ad block and all but there was no option for a video popout which is weird coz literally all browsers have it. So I've made one here. okay bye
# How to install:
- Open Brave and go to brave://extensions/.
- Enable Developer mode in the top right corner.
- Click Load unpacked and select the downloaded folder.
-Your extension should now be loaded and visible in the toolbar.
